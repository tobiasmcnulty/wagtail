What's new
==========

* Added ``WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD`` setting, which defaults to ``None``. If set to ``redirect``,
  when serving documents for download, Wagtail will return a redirect to the browser rather than
  using Sendfile or serving the document directly via Python. This performance improvement allows
  custom or centralized file storage backends such as S3 to serve documents directly, rather than
  requiring that your web server or Python process read and serve the file itself.

  As an alternative for primarily-static sites, ``WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD`` can be set to
  ``direct``. This will cause Wagtail to render the underlying file storage ``url`` directly as the
  download link for the document, rather than redirecting the user or serving the document via
  SendFile or Python. **Note:** Using ``WAGTAILDOCS_SERVE_METHOD == 'direct'`` will prevent from
  running any ``before_serve_document`` hooks or ``document_served`` signals your project has
  configured.
